# Artificial Intelligence :rocket:

## Purpose :dark_sunglasses:

The purpose of this repository is to understand how Artificial Intelligence fits into our lives, and when we can use it.

### Basics

- The field of AI isn't quite defined - it ranges from searching algorithms to self-driving cars. However, there are some key features of artificial intelligence, such as
- [ ] Autonomy, or the ability for a machine to do things by itself
- [ ] Adaptive, or the ability to change

You can't really quite rank and categorize AI because the field is so broad. Also, it isn't quite countable (you can't say, 'we need to increasre more AI' - rather, you should say, 'it uses AI methodologies')

###### Data Science

- Definition: Practical application of numbers and statistics (includes machine learning )
- Has some components of AI

###### Machine Learning

- Definition: Processes that improve with more information (subfield of AI)

###### Deep Learning

- Definition: Increasing knowledge of a certain field (subfield of machine learning)

### Analogies :open_book:

### User Stories :telescope:

1. Users will be able to look through the various examples and understand how to test well.
